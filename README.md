[00:02.83] You (you), you are (you are) my universe
[00:06.64] And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first
[00:11.44] And you (you), you are (you are) my universe, and I
[00:36.94] 
[00:22.81] In the night, I lie and look up at you
[00:27.36] When the morning comes, I watch you rise
[00:31.88] There's a paradise they couldn't capture
[00:35.47] That bright infinity inside your eyes
[00:53.97] 
[00:38.99] 매일 밤 네게 날아가 (가)
[00:41.37] 꿈이란 것도 잊은 채
[00:43.25] 나 웃으며 너를 만나 (나)
[00:45.88] Never-ending forever, baby
[00:58.88] 
[00:48.14] You (you), you are (you are) my universe
[00:52.22] And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first
[00:56.92] And you (you), you are (you are) my universe
[01:01.18] And you make my world light up inside
[01:19.68] 
[01:08.57] 어둠이 내겐 더 편했었지
[01:13.14] 길어진 그림자 속에서 (eyes)
[01:17.66] And they said that we can't be together
[01:21.06] Because, because we come from different sides
[01:43.56] 
[01:24.74] You (you), you are (you are) my universe
[01:28.70] And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first
[01:33.76] And you (you), you are (you are) my universe
[01:37.81] And you make my world light up inside
[01:56.31] 
[01:41.47] My universe (doo-doo, doo-doo)
[01:46.53] My universe (doo-doo, doo-doo)
[01:50.98] My universe (doo-doo, doo-doo)
[01:55.51] (You make my world)
[01:57.44] You make my world light up inside
[01:59.52] You make my world light up inside
[02:16.02] 
[02:02.31] 나를 밝혀주는 건
[02:03.96] 너란 사랑으로 수 놓아진 별
[02:06.86] 내 우주의 넌
[02:08.55] 또 다른 세상을 만들어 주는 걸
[02:10.41] 너는 내 별이자 나의 우주니까
[02:12.48] 지금 이 시련도 결국엔 잠시니까
[02:14.82] 너는 언제까지나 지금처럼 밝게만 빛나줘
[02:17.09] 우리는 너를 따라 이 긴 밤을 수놓을 거야
[02:28.59] 
[02:19.93] 너와 함께 날아가 (가)
[02:22.02] When I'm without you, I'm crazy
[02:24.37] 자 어서 내 손을 잡아 (아)
[02:26.59] We are made of each other, baby
[02:42.09] 
[02:28.50] You (you), you are (you are) my universe
[02:32.51] And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first
[02:37.62] And you (you), you are (you are) my universe
[02:41.62] And you make my world light up inside
[03:00.12] 
[02:45.30] My universe (you, you are)
[02:50.29] My universe (I just want)
[02:54.76] My universe (you, you are my universe, and I)
[03:04.16] My universe
